## 📖 What is Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr (pronounced like "dispatcher") is an **open-source powerhouse** for managing IPTV streams, EPG data, and VOD content with elegance and control.\
Born from necessity and built with passion, it started as a personal project by **[OkinawaBoss](https://github.com/OkinawaBoss)** and evolved with contributions from legends like **[dekzter](https://github.com/dekzter)**, **[SergeantPanda](https://github.com/SergeantPanda)** and **[Seth](https://github.com/sethwv)**.

> Think of Dispatcharr as the \*arr family's IPTV cousin — simple, smart, and designed for streamers who want reliability and flexibility.

## 🎯 What Can I Do With Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr empowers you with complete IPTV control. Here are some real-world scenarios:

💡 **Consolidate Multiple IPTV Sources**\
Combine streams from multiple providers into a single interface. Manage, filter, and organize thousands of channels with ease.

📺 **Integrate with Media Centers**\
Use HDHomeRun emulation to add virtual tuners to **Plex**, **Emby**, or **Jellyfin**. They'll discover Dispatcharr as a live TV source and can record programs directly to their own DVR libraries.
Auto-detection answers the HDHomeRun discovery broadcast on UDP 65001; run the container with `network_mode: host` (bridge networking does not forward LAN broadcasts) or add the tuner manually at `http://<host>:9191/hdhr/discover.json`. If discovery does reach the container but it advertises an unreachable container IP (bridge networking), set Settings → Stream Settings → HDHomeRun Advertised URL to the address clients should use (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:9191`). Device name, device ID and tuner count live under Settings → Stream Settings. Scope a tuner to a channel profile and/or an output (transcode) profile by name: `/hdhr/<channel profile>/`, `/hdhr/<output profile>/` or the combined `/hdhr/<channel profile>/<output profile>/` (legacy `/hdhr/output_profile/<id>/` still works).

📼 **Record with Built-in DVR**\
Schedule one-time or recurring recordings from the TV Guide, manage series rules, and optionally strip commercials with Comskip. Watch recordings while they're still in progress.

📡 **Create a Personal TV Ecosystem**\
Merge live TV channels with custom EPG guides from XMLTV or Schedules Direct. Generate schedules or use auto-matching to align channels with program data. Export as M3U, Xtream Codes API, or HDHomeRun device.

⏪ **Watch Catch-up / Timeshift**\
Replay recent programs from Xtream Codes providers that advertise archives. Catch-up sessions show up on the Stats page alongside live and VOD, with per-user and global controls.

🔧 **Transcode & Optimize Streams**\
Configure output profiles with FFmpeg transcoding to optimize streams for different clients (reduce bandwidth, standardize formats, or add audio normalization).

🔐 **Centralize VPN Access**\
Run Dispatcharr through a VPN container (like Gluetun) so all streams route through a single VPN connection. Your clients access geo-blocked content without needing individual VPNs, reducing bandwidth overhead and simplifying network management.

🚀 **Monitor & Manage in Real-Time**\
Track live, VOD, and catch-up sessions, client connections, and bandwidth usage with live statistics. Monitor buffering events and stream quality. Automatic failover keeps viewers connected when streams fail—seamlessly switching to backup sources without interruption.

👥 **Share Access Safely**\
Create multiple user accounts with granular permissions. Share streams via M3U playlists or Xtream Codes API while controlling which users access which channels, profiles, or features. Network-based access restrictions available for additional security.

🔌 **Extend with Plugins**\
Build custom integrations using Dispatcharr's robust plugin system. Automate tasks, connect to external services, or add entirely new workflows.

## 🚀 Get Started in Minutes

### 🐳 Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest
docker run -d \
  -p 9191:9191 \
  --name dispatcharr \
  -v dispatcharr_data:/data \
  ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest
```

> Customize ports and volumes to fit your setup.

First-time web setup is limited to local/private networks by default. If you are installing on a VPS or otherwise reaching the UI from a public IP, either create the admin with `docker exec <container> python manage.py createsuperuser`, or set `DISPATCHARR_SETUP_ALLOWED_IP` to your client IP (see comments in the compose files). The setup page also shows the IP Dispatcharr sees.

Behind a reverse proxy, set `DISPATCHARR_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your proxy's IP or CIDR so Network Access, Stats, and rate limits see real client IPs (defaults trust private/loopback peers; use `none` to ignore forwarded headers).

| **All-in-One Deployment**   | [docker-compose.aio.yml](docker/docker-compose.aio.yml) | ⭐ Recommended! A simple, all-in-one solution — everything runs in a single container for quick setup.        |
| **Modular Deployment**      | [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml)         | Separate containers for Dispatcharr, Celery, Redis, and Postgres — perfect if you want more granular control. |
| **Development Environment** | [docker-compose.dev.yml](docker/docker-compose.dev.yml) | Developer-friendly setup with pre-configured ports and settings for contributing and testing.                 |
